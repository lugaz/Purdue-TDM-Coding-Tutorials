# Question 1
# Create a program that takes a student's 
# score as input and uses an if-else statement to determine their letter grade.
# Assume the grading scale is as follows:

# A: 90-100
# B: 80-89
# C: 70-79
# D: 60-69
# F: Below 60
# The program should print the corresponding letter grade.

# Question 2
# Write a Python program that asks the user to enter
# an integer number. Use an if-else statement to 
# check if the number is even or odd. Print a 
# message indicating whether the number is even or odd.
