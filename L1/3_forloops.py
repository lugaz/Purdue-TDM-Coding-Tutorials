# Question 1:
#Write a program that uses nested for loops to print the following pattern:


# *
# **
# ***
# ****
# *****
    

































# Number of rows for the pattern
# rows = 5

# Outer loop to iterate through rows
# for i in range(1, rows + 1):
#     # Inner loop to print '*' for each column
#     for j in range(i):
#         print("*", end="")
#     # Move to the next line after each row
#     print()
